# 3. User stories

# 4. High fidelity prototypes

# 5. Usability tests
During the development, three usability tests were made and, based on these, the project was adapted to be more user-friendly.

1. User Story 1
Testing that the user is able to log in with email and password, can understand the error messages, and correct their mistakes.
- Users wanted to see more descriptive error messages (e. g., what was causing the error, what could you do to fix it).
- Change of color from the error messages, from black to red.

2. User Story 2 and 4

Testing:
- The user can annotate the table’s number.
- The user can add and delete products to an order.
- The user can see a summary and total purchase.
- The user can edit the order.
- The user can send order to kitchen.
- The user can see the orders ready to be served and the ones delivered.

Feedback:
- Users wanted to be redirected to the main screen by clicking on the logo.
- In the order summary, users wanted to see a description of said order (quantity, product and price).
- Bigger letter size in 'Verify order' screen.

3. User Story 3, 5 and 6

Testing:
- The user can mark an order ready to serve.
- The user can check how long did it take to prepare it.
- The user can see a list of all their employees.
- The user can add an employee, edit it and delete it.
- The user can see a list of all their products.
- The user can add a product, edit and delete it.

Feedback:
- Placeholders on forms can be confusing to the user.
