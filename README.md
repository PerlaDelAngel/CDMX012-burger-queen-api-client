## 1. Project description

This project is a *single page application* made with *React* for a small hamburger restaurant by the name of Burger Queen. Our application allows the management of different aspects of the restaurant based on the several roles an user can have, helping them to perform their assigned tasks. 

The roles we worked with are:

* **Manager:** Person in charge of keeping track of the employees, delete them or add new hires. They can also add, delete or edit any of the products in the menu.
* **Waiter:** They can take new orders, edit them and send them to the kitchen to be prepared. The waiter can access the "active orders" screen, where they will see the set of orders that have been served but not charged, or those that are ready to be served, once the kitchen marks them as such, and mark them as delivered after they have brought them to their respective clients. 
* **Chef:** The people working in the kitchen can see a list of orders that have been received and need to be cooked, can mark them as "ready" once they have been prepared, and can consult how long did it take to prepare them for optimization purposes. 

Our application is designed to be used on tablet devices, that's why we approached its design with a mobile-first perspective.

## 4. High fidelity prototypes

Having the user stories in mind, we created high fidelity prototypes in which we wanted to portray an easy to understand interface and provide our users an optimal work flow. This prototypes were key to develop the project.
